# Project: `ipConverter.com` backend

IPConverter is a C++ program built with an object-oriented design pattern that provides a set of tools for working with IP addresses. The program consists of several classes, each responsible for a specific feature or tool.

### Upcoming Features

* **IP Address Conversion**: Convert between different IP address formats, perform IP address operations, and support CIDR notation.
* **Geolocation Lookup**: Look up the geographic location associated with an IP address.
* **DNS Lookup**: Look up domain names and IP addresses.
* **Port Scanner**: Scan for open ports on a given IP address or range of IP addresses.
* **Ping Test**: Test the connectivity between two IP addresses or between an IP address and a hostname.
* **Traceroute**: Trace the path that packets take from one IP address to another, showing the intermediate hops along the way.
* **Whois Lookup**: Perform a Whois lookup on an IP address or domain name.
