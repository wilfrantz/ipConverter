# IPConverter : Design 

#### Introduction

The IPConverter program is a software application designed to provide users with a variety of tools and features related to IP addresses. The program will be built mainly in C++, with additional libraries and tools used as necessary to provide the required functionality.

#### Features

* IP address converter: 
  A tool that allows users to convert between different IP address formats, such as converting between IPv4 and IPv6.

* Geolocation lookup: 
  A tool that allows users to enter an IP address and see the location associated with that IP, including the country, city, and geographic coordinates.

* Reverse DNS lookup: 
  A tool that allows users to enter an IP address and see the domain name associated with that IP, as well as any other domains that resolve to that IP.

* IP address range calculator: 
  A tool that allows users to enter an IP address and a subnet mask and calculates the range of IP addresses that fall within that subnet.

CIDR calculator: A tool that allows users to enter a range of IP addresses and calculates the CIDR notation for that range.

WHOIS lookup: A tool that allows users to enter a domain name or IP address and see information about the domain registrar, owner, and other details.

IP address scanner: A tool that allows users to scan a range of IP addresses for open ports or other vulnerabilities.

API integration: Allow other developers to use your IP converter services via API.

Blacklist checker: A tool that allows users to enter an IP address and check if it is listed on any blacklists, which could indicate that it has been used for spam or other malicious activity.

Browser extensions: Allow users to quickly access your IP converter services via their web browser with ease.

IP address type conversion: The ability to convert IP addresses from one format to another. For example, converting an IPv4 address to IPv6 format or vice versa.

Decimal to Binary conversion: The ability to convert decimal numbers to binary format. This feature could be useful for understanding how IP addresses are represented in binary format.

CIDR notation support: The ability to input and output IP addresses in CIDR notation, which is commonly used for subnetting.

Network class identification: The ability to identify the network class of an IP address (Class A, B, C, D or E).

Subnetting calculator: The ability to calculate the network and host portions of an IP address based on a given subnet mask.

Reverse DNS lookup: The ability to look up the domain name associated with an IP address.

Geolocation: The ability to determine the geographic location of an IP address.

IP address range generator: The ability to generate a range of IP addresses based on a starting and ending IP address.

Whois lookup: The ability to perform a Whois lookup on an IP address, which can provide information about the owner of the IP address and the organization associated with it.

Port scanner: The ability to scan for open ports on a given IP address or range of IP addresses.

Ping test: The ability to test the connectivity between two IP addresses or between an IP address and a hostname.

Traceroute: The ability to trace the path that packets take from one IP address to another, showing the intermediate hops along the way.

DNS lookup: The ability to look up the IP address associated with a domain name.

MAC address lookup: The ability to look up the MAC address associated with an IP address.

Architecture

The IPConverter program will be built in C++ using an object-oriented design pattern. The program will consist of multiple classes, each responsible for providing a specific feature or tool consist of the following main classes:

IPConverter: The main class that provides the core functionality of the program. This class will be responsible for handling user input and output, as well as coordinating the interactions between other classes.

IPAddress: A class that represents an IP address and provides methods for converting between different IP address formats, as well as performing various operations related to IP addresses.

Geolocation: A class that provides methods for looking up the geographic location associated with an IP address.

DNSLookup: A class that provides methods for looking up domain names and IP addresses.

PortScanner: A class that provides methods for scanning for open ports on a given IP address or range of IP addresses.

PingTest: A class that provides methods for testing the connectivity between two IP addresses or between an IP address and a hostname.

Traceroute: A class that provides methods for tracing the path that packets take from one IP address to another, showing the intermediate hops along the way.

Whois: A class that provides methods for performing a Whois lookup on an IP address or domain name.

API Integration:

The IPConverter program will provide an API that other developers can use to access its features and functionality. The API will be designed using RESTful principles and will allow developers to perform various operations related to IP addresses, including IP address conversion, geolocation lookup, DNS lookup, and more.

Conclusion:

The IPConverter program will be a versatile and powerful tool for working with IP addresses. Its wide range of features and tools will make it useful for developers, network administrators, and anyone else who needs to work with IP addresses on a regular basis. Its object-oriented design and API integration will make it easy to use and integrate with other software applications.
